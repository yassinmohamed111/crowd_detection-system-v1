<h1>ðŸ‘¥ Crowd Detection System using YOLOv8</h1>

<h2>What's This?</h2>
<p>Welcome to the crowd detection system using YOLOv8! ðŸŽ‰ This system helps you detect and count the number of people in crowded scenes or images. We've built it with YOLOv8, one of the coolest object detection algorithms out there. ðŸš€</p>

<h2>Features ðŸŒŸ</h2>
<p>Detect & Count: It can detect and count the number of people in images or video streams, even in busy crowds!</p>
<p>Overlimit notifiying : prints red flag when the people detected is over the limit . </p>


<h2>Data Preparation with Roboflow ðŸ¤–</h2>
<p>We've powered up our dataset using Roboflow! With over 14,000 annotated images, our model is trained on a diverse range of crowd scenarios, ensuring robust performance across various environments.</p>

<h2>Training on Kaggle Notebooks ðŸ““</h2>
<p>To train our model, we utilized the powerful computational resources available on Kaggle's notebook environment. With its GPU support and seamless integration with Python libraries, training our YOLOv8 model was a breeze! </p>
